# Error Codes <Badge type="warning" text="Since 1.0.0-alpha.13"/>

The following table lists the error codes used in the TORCH system.
Each error code is unique and provides information about the type of error, its severity, and recommended actions for users and developers.

Error Code – A unique identifier for the error, structured as MODULE_SUBMODULE_NUMBER.

Meaning – A brief description of the error and its context.

Severity – Indicates the impact of the error (Info, Warning, Error, Critical).

User Action / Fix – Recommended steps the end user can take to resolve the issue.

Developer Notes – Additional technical information for developers to troubleshoot and address the error.

This table is intended to support both end users and developers in quickly identifying, diagnosing, and resolving issues encountered in the system.
